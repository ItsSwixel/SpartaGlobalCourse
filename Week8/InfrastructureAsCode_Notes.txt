    - Hardware waste
    - High labour costs 
- On-Premises + Mutability 
    - Inefficiency
    - High running cost 
    - Security concerns 
- Cloud + Mutability 
    - Inefficient + not using cloud's advantage 
- Cloud + Immutability
    - Efficient
    - Cost reduction 
    - Flexibility 

Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
- A method to provision and manage IT Infrastructure
- Uses machine-readable definition files (E.g. source code)
- Benefits 
    - Speed and simplicity
    - Configuration consistency 
    - Minimisation of risk 
    - Increased efficiency in development 
    - Cost saving 
- Best Practices
    - Codify everything 
    - Document as little as possible
    - Maintain version control 
    - Continuously test, integrate and deploy 
    - Make your infrastructure code modular

IaC parts:
- Configuration management 
    - Tools responsible for provisioning and maintaining the state of the systems 
    - Best known tools
        - Chef
        - Puppet 
        - Ansible 
- Orchestration
    - Once you create templates we need orchestration tools and scripts that talk to the cloud to pull them together into the architecture
        - CloudFormation (AWS)
        - Ansible 
        - Terraform
