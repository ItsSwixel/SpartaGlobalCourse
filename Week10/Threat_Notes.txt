Cyber Threat Intelligence:
- Look at the problem from the outside and look at what an adversary would do
- Understand as much as possible about the attackers 
- Sharing of known information about attacks 
- Known threat nodes
- How different groups attack 

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE):
- Specific instances of a weakness type that are demonstrably exploitable 
- Provides known vulnerabilities of products 
- Doesn't include risk, fix or exploit 
- cve.mitre.org 
- Mapped to OWASP Top 10
- Maintained by MITRE 

Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE):
- The root cause of a vulnerability
- NOT a database of vulnerabilities
- Catergorisation system for vulnerabilities and weaknesses in software 
- Each category of the type of flaw has an ID assigned to it 
- Vulnerabilities are based on these weaknesses 
- Shows related CVEs and CAPECs

Attack Pattern:
- A description of the common attributes and approaches employed by adversaries to exploit known weaknesses in cyber-enabled capabilities 
- Defines challenges that an adversary may face and how they go about solving it 
- Derives from the concept of design patterns but applied in a destructive rather than constructive context 
- Generated from in-depth analysis of specific real-world exploit examples 
- Requires knowledge about how specific parts of an attack are designed and executed
- Gives guidance on ways to mitigate the attack's effectiveness 
- Benefits 
    - Training 
        - Educate developers, testers, buyers, and managers 
    - Requirements 
        - Define potential threats 
    - Design 
         -Provide context for architectural risk analysis 
    - Implementation 
        - Prioritise review activities 
    - Verification 
        - Guide appropriate penetration testing 
    - Release 
        - Understand trends and attacks to monitor 
    - Response 
        - Leverage lessons learnt into preventative guidance 

MITRE CAPEC:
- How the weakness could be exploited
- Stands for Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification 
- Developed by leveraging CWE and CVE 
- Comprehensive dictionary and classification taxonomy of known attacks 
- Used by analysts, developers, testers, and educators 
- Mapping between CAPEC and CWE is not always one-to-one relationship 
- Attack pattern would have to exploit all the listed weaknesses, a subset, or just one 
- Often there are various weaknesses, each of which alone could be used to enable the exploit 
- Execution flaws generally have three phases 
    - Explore
        - The ways to find a potential target to attack 
    - Experiment
        - Ways to determine if the target contains the weakness 
    - Exploit 
        - Suggested techniques for conducting the actual attack 

MITRE ATT&CK:
- Adversarial Tactics, Techniques & Common Knowledge (ATT&CK)
- A knowledge base for adversary behaviour 
- Free, Open and globally accessible 
- Based on real-world observation 
- Focus on 
    - Tactics 
    - Techniques 
    - Procedures 
- Use knowledge of adversary to help defenders 
- Shift from indicators to behaviours 
- CAPEC Vs ATT&CK 
    - CAPEC 
        - Focus on app security 
        - Enumerates exploits against vulnerable systems 
        - Includes social engineering/supply chain 
        - Associated with Common Weakness Enumeration 
    - ATT&CK 
        - Focus on network defence 
        - Based on threat intelligence and red team research 
        - Provides contextual understanding of malicious behaviour 
            - Maps certain attacks to known adversaries
        - Supports testing and analysis of defence options 
- Mapping ATT&CK to CTI 
    - Understand ATT&CK 
    - Map data to ATT&CK 
    - Store and analyse 
    - Defence recommendation 
- attack.mitre.org
- Steps
    - Find behaviour 
    - Research behaviour 
    - Behaviour -> Tactics 
    - Find technique 
    - Compare results 
        - Different team members may have different ideas about motivation
- Mapping to ATT&CK 
    - Sources 
        - From Report/Finished 
            - Check what adversary/software does 
            - Analyse initial compromise and post-compromise 
                - Running a command 
                - Creating a foothold/task 
                - Establishing a connection 
                - Sending data 
            - Research the behaviour 
                - Consult other teams (Red, Blue, etc)
                - Search on the internet 
                - Academic and security-focused journals and reports 
                - Time-consuming task but builds knowledge 
            - Translate behaviour into tactic 
                - What is adversary trying to accomplish?
                - Tactics found on attack.mitre.org 
            - Find the technique 
                - Special behaviour to achieve a goal is often a single step 
                - The toughest part 
                - A behaviour might not be a technique 
                - Search MITRE ATT&CK (keywords, commands, etc)
            - Compare the results 
                - Analysts have bias, its normal
                - Different interpretations fro analysing the same situation
                - Discuss the results 
        - From Raw Data
