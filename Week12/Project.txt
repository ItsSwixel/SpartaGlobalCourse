Develop Enterprise vulnerability checker 
Over 100 systems in the enterprise 
    - some are systems that we got from other providers and some are bespoke 
    - some are on the network and some are on the cloud 
Multi-user framework 
    - Project/system managers can login and create projects they are working on 
    - Should be able to add components to the project 
- Framework should send notifications for all new vulnerabilities found for each component from multiple sources
- Must be able to add new sources of vulnerability easily 
- User database should be separate from the vuln database 
- Passwords must be hashed using bcrypt
- Passwords must contain a salt 
- SSL certificates needed for communications 
- App should be developed using TDD and OOP
- Deployment must be automatic using Terraform and Ansible
- Jenkins should be used for automation 
- App should be tested against bandit before its deployed 
- 3 Threat models
    - 1 for pipeline 
    - 1 for production environment 
    - 1 for framework itself
