Packet Tracer:
- IP Configurator on the desktop to add IPs
- Change hostname in the config tab
- Ping hosts from the command prompt
  - Ping packets are special ICMP packets
  - ICMP stands for Internet Control Messaging Protocol
  - It has two types, ICMP echo request and ICMP echo reply
- Simulation tab will show all the packets moving through the simulation
  - There is a packet filter available
  - You can pause and play and inspect the packets individually

Data-Link Layer:
- Prepares data for the physical network layer
- NIC-to-NIC communications within the same network
- Ethernet is only one type of protocols/devices used in a LAN
- Ethernet Family
  - Most common type of LAN
  - Connection modes
    - Half-duplex mode: It either sends or receives data, cannot do both
    - Full-duplex mode: send and receive at the same time
- Layer 2 Switches
  - Made up of small integrated circuits and the accompanying software that controls the data paths
  - Composed of several ports
    - Each port can connect to an end device or to another intermediary device
  - Forward traffic (based on dest. MAC address) received on port to another port where dest. is connected
  - A switch builds up a table based on source MAC addresses so that it knows which MAC address is on which port
    - If it doesn't know where the destination is then it broadcasts it (except to the port that it came from)
  - Switches will send STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) packets in order to find loops in the network and avoid them as they will crash the network
- Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
  - If you know the destination IP but you don't know the destination MAC address for switching
  - ARP is a layer 2 protocol used to find the MAC address of the NIC (on the same network) that has a certain IP address
  - ARP mechanism
    - Broadcast on the network asking other devices if they know what the MAC is
    - All devices will receive the request
    - Only the device with the destination IP will reply and that packet will contain its MAC address
    - When the MAC address is unknown ARP will fill it with all 1s (MAC address of all 1s means everyone)
  - arp -a will show the cache of everything in the ARP table
  - arp -d will delete the cache

Routers and Routing:
- A router is a device that forwards traffic between different computer networks
- Differences between level 2 switch and routers can be found in switch_vs_router.png
- Routers don't forward broadcast frames
- Splits broadcast domains
- Can connect networks using different technologies
- Default gateway
  - The IP address of where packets should go if they can't find the IP they should go to
  - This should be the IP of the router interface on that network
  - If this isn't set then you won't be able to send data between the networks as the devices won't know where the router is
- Small network routing
  - A simple computer with 2 NICs can be a router
- Routing table
  - A table of its known networks starting with directly connected networks (0 hops)
  - It has the network ID address and the subnet mask as well as which interface is connected to those
  - Routers will swap tables to make sure that they are up-to-date with how to get to all the networks and how many hops away they are
