Static Routing:
- The routers won't figure it out themselves, the admin has to input them manually
- The routing will only take this path and never deviate even if there is a change or issue
- Network space is the network that the router doesn't know
- Subnet mask is the mask of the network that it doesn't know yet
- The next hop is the IP address to the interface of the next router

Dynamic Routing:
- Networking technique that provides optimal data routing
- Can select paths according to real-time logical network layout changes
- It uses multiple algorithms and protocols
- Most popular routing protocols
  - Routing Information Protocol (RIP) (There is a version 2)
  - Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)
- Allows routers to share network information with other routers to help select the best path
- Able to re-calculate and re-route traffic when more optimal paths become available
- Many protocols
  - Interior Gateway Protocol (IGRP)
  - Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP)
  - Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)
  - Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
- There is an attack where someone poisons the routing tables to force traffic one way to spy on the traffic
  - Difficult to do, normally done with nation state espionage

Application Layer Protocols:
- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
  - Automates assignment of IP addresses, subnet masks, gateways, and other networking parameters
  - When host connects, DHCP server is contacted indirectly, and an address is requested
  - DHCP chooses an address from a configured range of addresses
  - DHCP leases that IP to the host for a configurable amount of time
  - Various devices can be a DHCP server, such as:
    - Router or Wireless Access Point (AP)
    - Dedicated DHCP Server (Computer)
    - Personal Computer with a DHCP Server Software
  - DHCP is a broadcast protocol so it can assign IPs to hosts within its broadcast domain
    - Each network has to have its own DHCP server
  - "DHCP server" port(67/UDP) and "DHCP client" port(68/UDP)
    - It is one of the rare protocols that have a specified client and server port
    - The client port is normally ephemeral but in this case it is static
  - Operations:
    - DHCP Client --> DHCPDISCOVER --> DHCP Server (Broadcast)
    - DHCP Client <-- DHCPOFFER <-- DHCP Server (Broadcast)
    - DHCP Client --> DHCPREQUEST --> DHCP Server (Broadcast)
    - DHCP Client <-- DHCPACK <-- DHCP Server (Broadcast)
  - Why is DHCP a broadcast protocol?
    - The packets are all broadcasts because the device is new so it doesn't have any idea where any of the devices are
    - The client also can't create a connection with the server because it doesn't have an IP address yet
    - You might have multiple DHCP servers on a network so a broadcast can request from multiple to get the IP the fastest
  - The command ipconfig /renew will force a DHCP renewal on Windows Machines

- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
  - Application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as Hyper text Markup Language (HTML)
  - Designed for communication between web browsers and web servers
  - Follows classic client-server model
  - Stateless protocol meaning the server does not keep any data between 2 requests
  - HTTPs
    - HTTPs is a secure version of the HTTP protocol that uses SSL/TLS for encryption and authentication
      - Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security (TLS is the new version, SSL is defunct)
    - HTTPs uses port 443 by default and is specified by RFC2818 (May 2000)
    - Makes it possible for people to transmit sensitive data over the internet
    - HTTPs very important for online activities such as shopping, banking, and remote work

- File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
  - Works in 2 modes, active and passive
    - Active works on port 21/TCP and passive works on port 20/TCP
  - FTP is not secure
  - You can transfer files using HTTP but FTP is much more professional and better for managing more files
  - FTPS
    - Also uses SSL/TLS and also runs on port 21 and is more secure than FTP alone
    - Isn't used too much these days
  - SFTP
    - The more common secure FTP protocol
    - Stands for SSH File Transfer Protocol
    - Works on port 22/TCP
      - Works off of the SSH port not the FTP port
  - Use ftp [IP] to connect and then enter username and password
  - Use get command to download from the FTP server
  - Use put to upload a file to the FTP server
  - quit exits out of the ftp program

- Domain Name System (DNS)
  - Domain names were created to convert numeric addresses into simple, recognizable names
  - Works on port 53
  30 TO 35 MINUTES MISSING PAGE HERE
  - DNS Hierarchy
    - Root level
      - Top level domains (TLD)
      - .net
      - .edu
      - .com
      - .au
      - .co
      - Other top level domains
        - cisco.com
          - www.cisco.com
          - ftp.cisco.com
          - mail.cisco.com
  - nslookup [domain name] will query the DNS server for the IP linked to that domain name
    - This can also be used to troubleshoot name resolution issues
  - DNS records
    - Address Mapping Record (A) Record - Stores a hostname and its IP address
    - Canonical Name (CNAME) Record - used to alias a hostname to another hostname
    - Mail Exchange (MX) Record  - specifies an SMTP email server for the domain, used to route outgoing emails to an email server
    - Start of Authority (SOA) Record - appears at beginning of DNS zone file and indicates
      - Authoritative Name Server for current DNS zone
      - Mail Box
      - Minimum TTL
      - Refresh
      - Retry
      - Expire

- Email Systems (IMAP/POP3)
  - Client-server method of communication
  - Three main options:
    - SMTP
      - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
      - Send email from client mailbox to client mailbox on server
      - Listens on port 25/TCP (no encryption) and 465 or 587 for encrypted (SMTP + SSL)
        - 465 shouldn't be used anymore as it got reassigned
    - POP3
      - Post Office Protocol
      - Used to retrieve emails from the server
      - Works on port 110
    - IMAP
      - Internet Message Access Protocol
      - Retrieve email from server
      - Works on port 143
        - 993 if using SSL
      - Check pop_vs_imap.png to see the difference/further information

Access Control List (ACL):
- Contains rules that grant or deny access to certain resources (E.g. files, computers, servers, networks, printers, systems, rooms, etc)
- ACLs tell networking devices what type of traffic can access the network, and which activity is allowed
- In networking, ACLs are usually applied on a specific interface in a specific direction
- A networking devices applies ACL on each packet as follows:
  - Get dest. and source IP address
  - Find a rule that matches the source and/or destination addresses/ports
  - If match found, check action in rule
    - Allow the packet to pass
    - Deny: drop the packet
  - The rules must have a hierarchy as it will always take the first rule that fits
  - If no match is found then drop the packet
    - Default final rule is deny everything
- Wildcard bits
  - Wildcards are the opposite of the subnet mask (replace 1 with 0, 0 with 1)
  - Check if the source/destination IP matches a specific rule
  - 0s mean they have to match in the rule and 255 means it can be anything
  
- Firewalls
  - A system or group of systems that enforce the ACL policy between networks
  - Prevents the exposure of sensitive hosts, resources, and applications to untrusted users
  - Sanitizes protocol flow, which prevents exploitation of protocol flaws
  - Blocks malicious data from servers and clients
  - Reduces security management complexity by off-loading most of network access control to a few firewalls
  - Misconfigured firewall can have serious consequences for the network, such as becoming a single point of failure
  - Network performance will slow
  - Unauthorised traffic can be tunnelled or hidden so that it appears as legit traffic through the firewall
  - Two commonly used types of policies
    - Allow list (formerly White-List)
      - Drop all packets except the ones specifically listed as acceptable
    - Deny list (formerly Black-List)
      - Allow all packets except what you specifically list as unacceptable
  - Firewall types
    - Packet Filtering Firewall
      - Works on transport and network layers
    - Stateful Firewall
      - Works on application, session, transport and network layers
      - Most common
      - E.g.
        - Firewall receives a packet from bbc.com going to server
        - Firewall keeps a connection table and if the firewall can't see data coming from server to bbc.com that packet is denied
        - Basically, this firewall takes previous packets into account for context and therefore can dynamically allow and block based on that context
          - It looks into the connection not just the individual packets
    - Proxy Firewall
      - Works on application layer
      - Deployed between remote user and dedicated server on the internet
      - Can be effective shielding and filtering mechanism between public networks and protected internal or private networks
      - Authentication schemes, such as passwords and biometrics, can be set up for accessing the proxies
      - Generally keep very detailed logs
      - Main disadvantage is speed
    - Web Application Firewall (WAF)
      - Build to provide web applications security by applying rules to a HTTP conversation
      - Certain ports must be kept open to the internet
      - This means attacks like XSS and SQL injection can be tried
    - Firewall Delivery Methods
      - Check firewall_methods.png
  - We have firewall zones to show where is protected by the firewall
    - These zones are called the inside zone, the outside zone and the demilitarized zone (DMZ)
    - Inside is the zone that we trust within our network
    - Outside is the zone outside the network that we don't have control over
    - The DMZ has selective access to/from the outside zone
      - The inside zone can access the DMZ but the DMZ cannot access the inside zone
