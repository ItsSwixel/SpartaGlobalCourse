Networking Basics:

Network Components:
- Hosts
  - Anything that can be connected such as PCs, Servers, etc
- Peer-to-Peer
- Intermediary Devices
  - Routers
  - Switches
  - Firewall
  - Etc
- Network Media
  - The way to connect the devices to exchange data
  - Cables or frequency for wireless etc

Network Infrastructure Type:
- LAN
  - Local Area Network
  - Based on geographic location such as in 1 building whether its 2 machines or 1000 machines
- WAN
  - Wide Area Network
  - An inter-connected set of LANs
  - Usually have a 3rd party providing a service such as an ISP
- Internet
  - Nobody has a clear image of what the internet looks like
  - An interconnected web (not web as the service) of all the public facing networks
  - The individual networks do not have to be accessible by everyone, they can be private whilst remaining part of the internet
  - Accessibility does not define anything about the internet
    - If you're connected then whether anyone has access or not or whether you're providing a service or not you're still connected to the internet
- Intranet
  - Private online network only accessible to people within an organisation
  - Connection has to be private
  - Must comprise of multiple LANs or WANs
- Extranet
  - Much like an intranet but part of it can be accessed by people outside the organisation
  - For example, parts of the network can be accessed by Suppliers, Customers, Collaborators etc

Communications Fundamentals:
- Message source
  - Person or device that needs to send a message to another person or device
- Message Destination
  - Where the message ends up to be interpreted
- Channel
  - Media that provides the pathway over which the message travels
- Message delivery options
  - Unicast
    - Message sent to a single end device
  - Multicast
    - Message sent to multiple specific end devices
    - Criteria set for why any end device would receive the message
  - Broadcast
    - Message sent to every end device
- Protocol Suites
  - They are put into layers because each layer has multiple different protocols etc
    - Its a more abstract look at the way that devices interact
  - ISO Suite (OSI Model)
    - 7. Application
      - Network process to application
      - What protocol the application is using
      - In reality, layers 5, 6, and 7 were merged together

    - 6. Presentation
      - Data representation and encryption
      - What is the data encoding that has been used

    - 5. Session
      - Interhost communication
      - Determines which connection sessions are separate from each other

    - 4. Transport
      - TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol
        - This would be the recorded mail in the example
        - TCP is used when reliability is needed over speed
        - Used for SMTP/IMAP and HTTP/HTTPS
        - Required properties
          - Reliable
          - Acknowledges data
          - Resends lost data
          - Delivers data in sequenced order
      - UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol
        - This would be the unrecorded mail in the example
        - UDP is used for applications that need speed over reliability
        - Use for VoIP and DNS
        - Required properties
          - Fast
          - Low overhead
          - Does not require acknowledgements
          - Does not resend lost data
          - Delivers data as it arrives
      - End-to-end connections and reliability
      - Doesn't care whether data has been verified or not
      - Decides whether the application cares about whether you know the packet got delivered or not
        - TCP tells you whether the packet has been received correctly
        - UDP doesn't care whether the packet has been received or not
      - E.g. Whether the package sent is sent as a recorded delivery or not
      
      - Port Numbers
        - Used to manage multiple, simultaneous conversations
          - Each tab on a browser will make requests on a different port so that the transport layer knows which session its coming from
        - Destination port number is associated with the destination application on the server host
        - Source port is associated with the originating application on the user's host
          - Source port becomes return address for sending the data from server to host
        - A server can offer more than one service at a time such as
          - SSH on port 22
          - HTTP on port 80
          - FTP on port 21
        - The source machine decides where the destination port is
          - But the destination port should be the one that the destination machine is listening on
          - If data is sent to a closed port then the data will be refused
          - Default port numbers are the ones that each protocol listens to by default so HTTP listens to port 80 by default
            - If the protocol on the destination machine isn't listening on the default port then the server owner needs to let the clients know which port to use
            - Not running your server on the default ports can be a security measure to allow access to people that know which port to connect to so that hackers have to guess all 65,536 ports
        - Most well-known ports got put on ports 0-1023
          - The most common ones can be found in Very_well_known_ports.png
        - Registered ports are from 1024-49,151
          - Assigned by IANA to other specific processes/applications but they aren't the common ones
          - Registered ports aren't used in all standards. In this case all ports after common are ephemeral ports
        - Private or dynamic ports are from 49,152-65,535
          - These are known as ephemeral ports
          - Client's OS assigns these dynamically when a connection to a service is initiated
          - E.g. Open ephemeral port to collect webpage data on a new tab and then close it as its not needed anymore

    - 3. Network
      - Path determination and logical addressing
      - Adds the logical addressing to the packets
        - Looks at the protocols from the previous 2 layers and decides how to add the logical
        - For example, if its WiFi or Ethernet you'd add an IP address
      - Performs the routing function to find the best path for each packet
      - E.g. How to get the post from a post office to the destination house

    - 2. Data Link
      - Physical addressing
      - Define protocol to exchange the data on the physical layer

    - 1. Physical
      - Media, signal, and binary transmission
      - The physical and electronic transmission specifications
  - TCP/IP Protocol Suite
    - Application layer
    - Transport layer
      - TCP
      - UDP
    - Internet layer
      - Internet Protocol
      - Messaging
      - Routing Protocols
    - Network Access layer
      - Address Resolution
        - ARP
      - Data Link Protocols
  - Encapsulation
    - Look at Network_encapsulation_diagram.png

Addressing Standards:
- Positional Numeral Systems
  - Digits represent different values based on their relative positions
- In networking we use 3 systems
  - Decimal Number System (base 10)
  - Hexadecimal Number System (base 16)
  - Binary Number System (base 2)

MAC Addresses:
- MAC address consists of 2 parts
  - The first 6-digits identifies the manufacturer and this is called the OUI (Organization Unique Identifier)
  - The second set of 6 digits identifies the device itself
- How to find the MAC address
  - On windows, ipconfig /all in the command prompt/powershell
  - On Linux, ifconfig in the terminal
  - On Mac, ifconfig in the terminal

IPv4 Addressing System:
- Network ID when the host portion is all 0s
- Broadcast address is when the host portion is all 1s
- 2 systems to recognise the network portion of the IP address
  - Legacy Classful System
    - The main issue of this was that we were wasting too many IPs
    - Class A
      - 2 IPs from the same network if they have the same first octet
      - 8-bit network ID
      - Starts with 0
      - First octet in decimal is 0-127
      - 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 are private
        - Subnet mask 255.0.0.0
    - Class B
      - 2 IPs from the same network if they have the same first 2 octets
      - 16-bit network ID
      - Starts with 10
      - First octet in decimal is 128-191
      - 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 are private
        - Subnet mask 255.240.0.0
    - Class C
      - 2 IPs from the same network if they have the same first 3 octets
      - 24-bit network ID
      - Starts with 110
      - First octet in decimal is 192-223
      - 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 are private
        - Subnet mask 255.255.0.0
    - Class D
      - 32-bit Multicast Group Address
      - Starts with 1110
      - First octet in decimal is 224-239
    - Class E
      - 32-bit Experimental Address Space
      - Starts with 1111
      - First octet in decimal is 240-255
  - Classless system (using subnet masks)
- Loopback addresses 127.0.0.0/8
- Link-Local addresses 169.254.0.0/16
  - Known as Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) addresses or self-assigned addresses
