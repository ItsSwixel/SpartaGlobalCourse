Integrity - Asymmetric Encryption and Hashing:
- Alice hashes the message
- Alice then encrypts the message (not the hash) with Bob's public key so only he can decrypt it using his private key
- She encrypts the hash with her own private key
  - This can therefore be decrypted by anyone using Alice's public key but cannot be encrypted again in the same way as nobody has her private key
- Both the encrypted message and the encrypted hash are sent to Bob
- Bob decrypts the hash using Alice's public key and if it works then we know its directly from Alice
  - If the decryption doesn't work then we know it was decrypted and encrypted again (man-in-the-middle)
- If the message has been verified to be from Alice, using the decryption, the message is decrypted using Bob's private key
- The message is then hashed and compared to the hash that was decrypted using Alice's public key
- If the 2 hashes are the same then we know that the message has not been changed

Public Key Infrastructure:
  Digital Signatures:
    - Digital signatures are a mathematical technique used to provide authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation
    - Properties:
      - Authentic: Signature cannot be forges and provides proof that the signer, and nobody else, signed the document
      - Unalterable: After a document is signed, it cannot be altered
      - Not reusable: The document signatures cannot be transferred to another document
      - Non-repudiated: The signed document is considered to be the same as a physical document
        - Person who signed document should not be able to deny that they were the one that signed it
    - Standards:
      - Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)
        - Original standard used to gen public and private key pairs
      - RSA
        - Commonly used for generating and verifying digital signatures
      - Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)
        - Newer variant of DSA and provides authentication and non-repudiation
    - Code signing
      - Provide assurance of the authenticity and integrity of software code
  Digital Certificates:
    - Equivalent to an electronic passport. Enables users, hosts, and organisations to securely exchange data over the internet
    - These certificates are given out by a trusted 3rd party
    - Proves that an entity is the owner of a certain public key
    - Certificate Authority gives Bob a PKI Certificate
    - Bob exchanges the PKI Certificate with Alice
    - Alice can then verify that certification with the CA
    Certificate Authorities:
      - CA's work in a tree hierarchy
      - The root CA will gives certificates to Sub CA's who can then give certificates to everyone else
    X.509 and Application:
      - Standard for how the certificate should be formatted
      - Secure web servers use X.509v3 for websites
      - Web browsers use it to implement HTTPS client certs
      - User mail agents that suport mail
      - Cisco switches use it
      - IPsec VPNs
    Certificate Revocation:
      - Certs are revoked if compromised or no longer needed
      - If someone manages to steal your private key then the cert needs to be revoked as you can no longer confirm that its you using it
      - Two common methods of revocation:
        - Certificate revocation list (CRL)
        - Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)

Access Control Modes:
- Discretionary access control (DAC)
  - Owner of the file gets to decide who can do what
  - Least restrictive system
- Mandatory access control (MAC)
  - Files and resources have clearance levels and people with the right clearance level can use it
  - Used in the military
  - One of the most restrictive systems
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Resources are locked unless you hold certain roles in the organisation
  - E.g. Salary database can only be accessed by head of human resources
    - Someone in the company that is higher up still wouldn't have access in this system as they aren't the head of human resources
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
  - E.g. This server can only be accessed from within the company
  - E.g. This server can only be accessed between 09:00 and 17:00
- Rule-based access control (RBAC)
  - Security team sets rules as to who can access the server
  - E.g. These IPs can access the server and these protocols can but these ones can't
- Time-based access control (TAC)
  - Rules based on the time and date
  - E.g. Servers can't be accessed on the weekend
- The principle of least privilege
