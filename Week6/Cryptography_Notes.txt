Essentials:
- Encryption
  - Process of transforming the original information into an unrecognizable form
- Decryption
  - Process of taking encoded text and turning it into a human readable form

Ciphers:
- Algorithm consisting of a series of well-defined steps that can be followed when encrypting data

Encryption Classes:
- Symmetric encryption algorithms
  - Block ciphers
    - Encryption done a block at a time and sent as blocks
  - String ciphers
    - Encryption done a bit at a time as a continuous stream
- Asymmetric encryption algorithms

Symmetric Encryption:
  AES:
  - Modes
    - ECB (Electronic Code Book mode)
      - Encrypt each block in sequence using the same key for all
    - CBC (Cypher block chaining mode )
      - Starts with an initialisation vector
      - Plaintext gets XOR'd with the plaintext block before its encrypted with key
      - Each encrypted block then gets XOR'd with the next block before encryption
    - CFB (Cipher Feedback) (Stream cipher)
    - OFB (Output Feedback) (Stream cipher)
    - CTR (Counter)

OpenSSL:
- Generate keys and IV values
  - openssl enc [algorithm] -k secret -P -md sha1
- Encrypting with openssl
  - openssl [algorithm] -e -in [file in] -out [file out] -K [key] -iv [IV value]
- Decrypting with openssl
  - openssl [algorithm] -d -in [file in] -out [file out] -K [key] -iv [IV value]

Asymmetric Encryption:
- Both keys can be used for encryption and decryption but encryption key must be different from decryption key
  - E.g. If Key 1 encrypts then Key 2 must decrypt and vice-versa
- Uses 512-bit keys minimum, up to 4096-bit keys
  - Longer keys take longer and are more resource intensive
Algorithms:
- Diffie-Hellman (DH)
  - Allows two parties to agree on a shared identical secret key without having communicated before
  - Shared key is never communicated between the 2 parties
  - Where is DH used
    - Data is exchanged using an IPsec VPN
    - Data is encrypted on the internet using SSL or TLS
    - SSH data is exchanged
  - Look at Diffie-Hellman_explained.png
- Digital Signature Standard (DSS) and Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)
- RSA Encryption
- ElGamal
- Elliptical curve techniques
  - Used to adapt many algorithms, such as Diffie-Hellman or ElGamal. Main advantage is that keys are much smaller

Cryptographic Hashing Operations:
- Hashes are used to verify and ensure data integrity
- Based on one-way mathematical function that is easy to compute but hard to reverse
- Can be used to verify authentication
- Computationally infeasible for different data sets to come with the same hash output

Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC):
- Adds an additional secret key as well as the plaintext message as an input to the hash function

Interview Practice:
- REVISE RISKS VS THREATS
