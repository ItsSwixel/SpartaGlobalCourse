Access Control Modes:
- Discretionary access control (DAC)
  - Owner of the file gets to decide who can do what
  - Least restrictive system
- Mandatory access control (MAC)
  - Files and resources have clearance levels and people with the right clearance level can use it
  - Used in the military
  - One of the most restrictive systems
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Resources are locked unless you hold certain roles in the organisation
  - E.g. Salary database can only be accessed by head of human resources
    - Someone in the company that is higher up still wouldn't have access in this system as they aren't the head of human resources
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
  - Time-based AC is kind of part of ABAC
  - E.g. This server can only be accessed from within the company
  - E.g. This server can only be accessed between 09:00 and 17:00
- Rule-based access control (RBAC)
  - Security team sets rules as to who can access the server
  - E.g. These IPs can access the server and these protocols can but these ones can't
- Time-based access control (TAC)
  - Rules based on the time and date
  - E.g. Servers can't be accessed on the weekend
- The principle of least privilege

AAA Framework:
- Authentication
  - Users must prove that they are who they say they are
- Authorisation
  - Authorisation services determine which resources the user can access and which operations they can perform
- Accounting
  - Recording what the user does, including what is accessed, amount of time it was accessed, and any changes that were made

AAA Architecture:
- Local AAA Authentication
  - Sometimes known as self-contained authentication
  - Authenticates users against locally stored usernames and passwords
- Server-based AAA Authentication
  - Authenticates against a central AAA server that contains usernames and passwords for all users

Famous AAA Protocols:
- Remote authentication dial-in service (RADIUS)
  - Supports centralised authentication, authorisation, and accounting for clients that establish a connection to a network and intend to use services
- Terminal access controller access control system (TACACS)
  - Old system used on UNIX systems that allow remote servers to forward logon requests to authentication servers
- TACACS+
  - Made by Cisco as response to RADIUS
- Kerberos

SSH Lab:
- ssh-keygen -t rsa (Created rsa keys)
- ssh-copy-id -i [path to public rsa key] [ssh server IP]
  - Copies client public key to the authorised keys file on the server

SSH-Agent Lab:
- eval `ssh-agent` (To make sure that the agent is running)
- ssh-add (Adds your private key to the agent)
- ssh -A [remote IP] (Forwards the agent during the ssh connection)
  - Edit config in .ssh folder to add a way for this to happen automatically (Check ssh_config_example.png)
- SSH Agent is used to prove authentication to an ssh server that already has your public key in its known keys so you don't need a password

- /etc/hosts file can be used to map names to IP addresses locally for ssh purposes (Check etc_hosts.png)

Fundamentals of Authentication:
- Something you know
  - Password, PIN, etc
- Something you have
  - Flash drive, proximity card, etc
- Something you are
  - Biometrics, fingerprint, etc

- Passwords
  - Most common form of authentication
  - Average person has 25 different online accounts
  - 54% of people use different passwords across accounts
  - At one time, 86% of more than 2 million breaches passwords were identical to passwords that had already been breached
  - Top 10 most common passwords include, 123456, Qwerty, 123456789, password, etc
  - NCSC released a list of the top 100,000 passwords that have been in a breach
  - Bad password practice
    - Using dictionary words
    - Using personal information
    - Using patterns
    - Using character substitutions
    - Using numbers and special characters only at the end
    - Using common passwords
    - Basically anything but a random password is a bad password
  - Attacks and Defence
    - Attacks
      - Brute-force attack
      - Rainbow Table Attack
    - Defence
      - Salting technique
      - Key stretching
        - Password + salt and hash them
        - Result of that hash will be the input of another hash
        - This can be done multiple times

- Token Authentication
  - A material device that is used to access secure systems
  - E.g. RFID card, chipset, dongle, etc

- Biometric Authentication
  - Advantages
    - Can be easily compared to features saved in a database
    - Control physical access on doors and entrances
    - Can be added into multi-factor authentication
  - Methods
    - Facial recognition
    - Fingerprint scanners
    - Voice identification
    - Iris scanners

- Multi-Factor Authentication
  - Examples include codes from phones, Captcha tests, fingerprints, or facial recognition
  - Increase confidence of users by adding multiple layers of security
  - MFA is good defence but has its own issues as people may lose their phones or SIM cards and not be able to generate a code.

- Authentication Protocols
  - NTLM (Windows New Technology LAN Manager)
  - KERBEROS
  - PAP (Password authentication protocol)
    - Very weak protocol
  - CHAP (Challenge handshake authentication protocol)
  - Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS)

Web App Authentication:
- Recognise user identity against credential information
- Associate incoming request (E.g. HTTP Request) with a set of credentials for identity or an identifier (E.g. session IF or Token)
- Cookie-based authentication
  - Cookies are a small piece of data created by the server and sent to the browser
  - We read cookies as key-value pairs
  - Browsers often need to store information for authentication and cookies can be used for this to keep you logged in on a website using a session ID, etc
