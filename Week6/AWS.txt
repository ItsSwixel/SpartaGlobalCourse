Amazon Web Services (AWS):
Best Practices:
- Naming convention
  - groupID_projectName_username_resourceName
  - E.g. cyber94_calculator_lcooper_server
- Always stop the instances when not in use
- Delete resources when no longer needed

Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2):
- EC2 provides scalable computing capacity in AWS
- Can be used to launch as many or as few virtual servers as needed, configure security and networking, and manage storage
- Allows you to scale up and down as needed
Components
- Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a template that contains a software
- Instance is a version of the server in the cloud
- Key pairs
  - A key pair consisting of a public and private key to prove your identity when connecting to an instance

Simple Storage Service (S3):
- Simple web interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web.
  - S3 main components:
    - Buckets
      - Container for objects stored in S3. Every object is contained in a bucket
    - Objects
      - Fundamental entities stored on S3 (Basically files). Consist of object data and metadata. Uniquely identified within a bucket by a key (name) and version ID
    - Keys
      - Unique identifier for an object within a bucket. Every object has exactly one key

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):
- You can create subnets within your VPC
- VPC
  - Virtual network in the cloud
- Each subnet within the VPC will have its own routing table
- Internet gateway
  - Allows traffic to go and come from the internet to the VPC which is otherwise isolated from the outside
- VPC endpoint
  - Privately connect your VPC to supported AWS and VPC endpoints
- CIDR block
  - Classless Inter-Domain Routing

Security Groups:
- Acts as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instance to control incoming and outgoing traffic
- When you launch an instance you can pick one or more security groups
- If you don't specify then EC2 will use a default group
- You can modify the rules at any time
- New rules are applied to all instances using that security group automatically
- When packets come in they are checked against every rule in every security group
- Security groups are stateful

Network Access Control List (NACL):
- Not attached to an instance, attached to a subnet within the VPC
- Used to allow/block traffic to an entire subnet
- Compares packets to rules in order until one matches
- NACL are stateless
  - Stateless means that it doesn't take connections into account and therefore you have to make rules to allow the response. Stateful will track connections and allow these responses automatically.
- A rule to allow the response should be added
- Ephemeral ports should be taken into consideration
