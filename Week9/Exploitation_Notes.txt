Exploit Categories:
- Two categories:
    - Known exploits
        - Known to the system or software developers 
    - Unknown exploits 
        - There is no documentation of this or any current solution 
        - Zero-day attacks typically take advantage of unknown exploits 
- Exploits are typically named by the following:
    - The type of vulnerability they exploit 
    - Whether they are local or remote 
        - Local performed on the same machine 
        - Remote exploited from a network at a distance 
    - Can also be named after the result after running the exploit
Exploit Types:
- Null or Default passwords - Default Shared Keys 
    - Commonly associated with networking hardware 
    - Come in many legacy OS's 
    - Admins sometimes create privileged user accounts in a rush and leave the password null
    - Most common in Wireless Access Points and pre-configured secure server applications 
- Network exploits 
    - IP Spoofing 
    - Man-in-the-middle 
    - Firewall traversal 
    - ARP Poisoning
        - Try to poison ARP table for one or more hosts to make them think that MAC's belong to someone else 
        - Spoofing makes switch believe you have the MAC whereas poisoning actively changes the ARP tables for all involved 
- Eavesdropping 
    - Sniffing between 2 communicating nodes
    - Works mostly with plain text transmission protocols 
    - Remote attacker must have access to a compromised system 
    - Cryptography protects you against this 
    - Remote man-in-the-middle attack?
- Service vulnerabilities 
    - HTTP-based services are vulnerable to remote command 
    - Services that have vulnerabilities, such as: Buffer Overflow 
    - Admins should make sure that services don't run as root 
    - Some exploits on web-servers 
        - Session hijacking 
        - SQL/Code injection 
        - Directory traversal 
        - Cross-site scripting (XSS)
        - URL Manipulation Through HTTP GET Methods 
        - Password cracking 
- Host-Based Vulnerability 
    - Workstations and desktops are more prone to exploitation 
    - Safeguards can be implemented
        - E.g. email client that doesn't automatically open or execute attachments 
    - Always automate updates of software on workstations 
- Denial of Service Attacks 
    - Ping flood attack: The most reported DoS case in the US occurred in 2000
    - Source packets are usually forged 
    - IDS/IPS/IDP 
        - Advances in ingress filtering using iptables and Network IDSes have gotten better at tracking down and preventing DDoS attacks 
- Exploit Kits 
    - Tools embedded in compromised web pages 
    - Automatically scan visitor's machines for vulnerabilities and attempt to exploit them 
    - If they succeed then the kit injects malware into the user's machine 
    - Easy to use and they have friendly user interfaces that allow non-expert users to deploy them as well 
    - They work in the background so its hard to know that you're under attack 
    - Avoid unknown links and keep software up to date to avoid this
    - Examples 
        - RIG EK
        - GrandSoft 
        - Magnitude 
        - Nuclear 
        - Neutrino

Metasploit:
- Open-source project 
- Provides public resource for research vulns and developing code 
- Gives security professionals ability to infiltrate their own network and identify security risk and vulnerabilities
