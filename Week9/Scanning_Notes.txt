Scanning:
- Definition 
    - Scanning is 
        - A set of procedures
        - For identifying live hosts, ports and services 
        - For discovering OS and architecture of target system 
        - Identifying vulnerabilities and threats in the network 
- Network scanning 
    - Process of gathering information about a network to determine all active devices on it 
    - Maybe types of network scan but can categorise based on what actions are being taken
    Types:
        - Passive scanning 
            - Silently analyse network traffic (packet sniffing) to identify endpoints and traffic patterns 
            - TCPDump and Wireshark are both famous tools for this 
            - Has some limitations:
                - Can't find devices or applications that never communicate on the network 
                - Infected systems intentionally distributing misinformation
        - Active scanning 
            - Sending traffic into the network and querying individual endpoints 
            - Three levels on active scanning:
                - Host Scanning 
                    - Detecting all active hosts on the network and mapping them to their IP addresses 
                    - 2 protocols most commonly used:
                        - ARP Scans
                            - Send out to many IP addresses to determine which are up based on which ones respond 
                        - ICMP Scans 
                            - Types of ICMP packets can be used 
                                - Echo (or ping) requests
                                - Timestamp messages to determine latency between hosts 
                                - Address mask request to get the subnet mask for the network 
                - Port Scanning 
                    - Process of sending packets to specific ports on a host and analysing the responses to learn details about its running services or vulnerabilities 
                    - Attempts to classify ports into one of three designations:
                        - Open: Destination responds
                        - Closed: You get a reply saying there is no service listening 
                        - Filtered: No reply 
                    - Port scanning methodology
                        - Vanilla: Scan all 65535 ports 
                        - Strobe: Scan only known services/ports 
                        - Sweep: Scan the same ports on several machines 
                    - TCP Handshake
                        - 3-way handshake 
                            - Client sends SYN packet 
                            - Server responds SYN ACK if there was a service on that port listening
                            - Client then send ACK packet back
                        - Used in SYN flooding where attacker sends SYN packets but ignores the SYN ACK packet 
                            - Can be used in Denial of Service
                    - TCP Scanning 
                        - SYN Scans (Port closed or not?)
                        - ACK Scan (Port filtered or not?)
                        - TCP Connect Scan (Uses the full handshake)
                        - NULL, FIN, and Xmas Scans 
                            - NULL = no flag 
                            - FIN = Send FIN flag 
                            - Xmas = Alternating flags one on, one off 
                        - Results:
                            - Closed: a RST (or ICMP port unreachable) packet
                                - Not all OS send RST packets 
                            - Open or Filtered: No response 
                        - IDLE Scans 
                            - Spoofed IP to send SYN packet 
                            - Not easy as you spoof IP but need to make sure response comes back to you
                            - Must be able to control the router/switch
                    - UDP Scanning 
                        - Send UDP packet to many ports 
                        - Receiving:
                            - UDP packet: port is open 
                            - ICMP port unreachable: closed port 
                            - No response means port is either open or filtered
                - OS Fingerprinting 
                    - Attempting to determine the OS running on a host 
                    - Common techniques are based on analysing:
                        - IP TTL Values
                        - The IP DF Option 
                        - The IP Type of Service 
                        - IP ID values 
                        - TCP Window Size (How many packets do you send at a time?)
                        - TCP Options 
                        - Initial Sequence Number 
                        - DHCP request 
                        - ICMP request 
                        - HTTP packets (User agent field. E.g. Firefox working on Linux)
                        - Running services 
                        - Open port patterns 
                - Hybrid Scanning 
                    - Using both active and passive scanning together is important 
                    - Be aware of consequences of different types to make the best decision 
                    - Active scanning should be carried out temporarily to avoid production downtimes or disruptions 
                    - Passive offers lower chance of disruption but doesn't give the same results 
    - Network Scanners:
        - Nmap
            - Free and open-source 
            - Useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime 
            - Uses raw IP packets to determine:
                - Hosts on the network 
                - Services 
                - OS and versions 
                - Type of firewalls being used 
            - Nmap has several utilities
                - Classic command-line 
                - Advanced GUI and results viewer (Zenmap)
                - Flexible data transfer, redirection, and debugging tool (Ncat)
                - Scan results comparison (Ndiff) 
                - Packet generation and response analysis tool (Nping)
- Vulnerability Scanning 
    - The act of identifying potential vulnerabilities in network devices such as firewalls, routers, switches, servers and applications 
    - A vulnerability scanner:
        - scans a specified set of ports on a remote host 
        - tries to test the service offered at each port for its known vulnerabilities 
        - Its automated 
        - Do not exploit vulnerabilities (This has to be done separately)

        - Compliance based 
    - Things to consider when running scans 
        - Are your systems accessible to the scanner?
        - Are any of your systems protected by an IPS/IDS or WAF?
        - Do you need authentication?
