Advanced Virtualisation:

Intro:
- Issue of variation between development and production environment
  - Development environment is where you develop the application
  - Production environment is where you set up to provide the service
  - Each might have a different OS, updates, plugins, etc
  - Issue gets more complex when you talk about a team
- 2 solutions
  - Vagrant
    - Usually used in development environment
  - Docker
    - Usually used in production environment

Vagrant:
- A tool for building and managing virtual machine environments in a single workflow
- Lowers development environment setup time
- Mirrors the production environment on the developer's machines
- The developer can still use their favourite editors, IDEs, and browsers
- Vagrant will make a virtual environment for each production environment
- Vagrant itself is not a Hypervisor
- Vagrant depends on an external Hypervisor, such as
  - Virtualbox
  - Hyper-V
  - VMware
- Vagrant calls the Hypervisor a Provider
- Vagrant can run on all major operating systems and architectures
- Commands
  - vagrant init [name of vagrant box]
  - vagrant up
  - vagrant ssh
    - Connects to the machine
  - vagrant halt
- /vagrant in the root is the shared file with the host system
- If you have an issue with the box delete the .vagrant folder
  - This will create a new VM so just delete the old one
- If it has issues with VBoxManager close the VBox Frontend in task manager
- At the bottom of the vagrant file you can make it install packages by un-commenting from config.vm.provision onwards at the very bottom
