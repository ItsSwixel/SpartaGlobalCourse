- Virtualisation is the process of separating a software from the hardware
- E.g. A virtual server does not exist in a physical form, it only exists in a virtual format.
- Hypervisor (also known as Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM)) works as an interface between VMs and the host
- You can't run 2 OS's directly on the hardware as they will be competing for the physical hardware
- Put the Hypervisor between the OS and the physical hardware and then you can run multiple virtual machines all on the same hardware
- These machines don't have to be running the same OS
- Each machine is given set resources by Hypervisor so each machine won't interact with the others' resources

Virtualisation Types:
- Type 1
  - Hypervisor runs directly on the hardware without the hardware having it's own OS
    - With no Host OS it doesn't take overhead so Type 1 gives better performance
  - This is called Native/Bare-Metal
  - No middle layer
  - Security - Hypervisor Security
    - If one VM gets compromised then all the others are potentially still safe as they are self-contained
  - E.g. Xen, Microsoft Hyper V, VMware ESX/ESXi
- Type 2
  - The host's machine is running on a normal OS. The Hypervisor is then installed on top of that OS as software and shares resources with
  all other applications
  - This type is easier to get up and running
  - This is called Hosted
  - Middle layer of the Host's OS
  - Security - Hypervisor Security + Host's OS Security
    - The more layers you have the more you have to try and protect making it harder to protect
    - If the Host OS gets compromised then so are the virtual machines
  - E.g. VMware Workstation, VMware player, VirtualBox

Linux Architecture:
- Kernel
- Shell
- Applications
- Distributions
  - Different forms of the Linux OS customised for different purposes
  - 3 Main distros
    - Debian
      - Ubuntu
      - Kali
    - Fedora
      - Red Hat
      - Centos
    - Arch Linux
-File systems
  - EXT4, EXT3, BTRFS, XFS
  - EXT4 is the most common now
  - Linus file system works on the concept that everything starts from the "root"
  - The concept that everything is a File
  - Commands, names of files and directories are case sensitive
  - Hidden files/directories start with "."
- Linux Shell
  - Text interface to the Kernel
  - Referred to as command line, terminal, console, prompt
  - How to launch
    - Activities/Start -> Shell or Terminal
    - CTRL + Alt + T
  - ls command
    - The number is how many hard links go to that file or directory
    - The -h option will give file size in a more readable format

Git SSH:
- ssh-keygen
  - Generate a public private key pair
- Put the public key in the github website
- ssh-add [path to private key]
- Should be working
