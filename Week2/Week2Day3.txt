Users:
- In each line of the passwd file:
  - Username
  - Password placeholder
  - UID
  - GID
  - User info
  - Home directory
  - Default shell for the user
- Processes themselves will create their own users sometimes
- Password hashes are stored in /etc/shadow

Packages:
- APT stands for Advanced Package Tool
- If package manager gets stuck after update use this command
  - Find the process ID using ps -ef
  - Kill the apt process using sudo kill [process ID]
    - Kill the parent process
    - Adding the parameter -9 to the kill command will force it to close (kill [process ID] -9)


- ps -ef will show you all processes running and what file they are accessing
- lsof [filepath] will show the process that is using the file that you specify
