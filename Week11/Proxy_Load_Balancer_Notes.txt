Forward Proxy:
- A server to pass the requests from the clients on a private/isolated network to the internet (and the responses back to the client)
- Caching
- E.g. Squid for HTTP/s (Open source)

Reverse Proxy:
- A server to pass the HTTP/s requests from the clients on the internet to a server/multiple servers on a private/isolated network (and the response back to the clients)
- E.g. Nginx
- Caching
- Compression 
- SSL/TLS Termination
- Authentication

Linux Links:
- ln -s [file to point to] [name of link]
    - Creates a soft link to another file within the file system
    - Saves the need for duplicated files
- ln [file to point to] [name of link]
    - This is a hard link 
    - This means the link is pointing directly to the content in file1 and not the file file1 itself

Nginx:
- sites-available
    - /etc/nginx/sites-available
    - All the websites in Nginx
- sites-enabled
    - /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
- /var/html/www
    - The directory that Nginx looks for pages by default

Load Balancer:
- A server that balances the received requests to a group of servers that do the same job (And the responses back to clients)
- A generic concept that can be used with any protocol 
- Can be used together with a reverse proxy (for HTTP/s)
- E.g. Nginx for HTTP/s
